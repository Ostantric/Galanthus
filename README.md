# Galanthus

Snow blowers or snow plows are the go-to method for snow removal. Building on what we already use, these apparatuses can be improved to require less human labor. Galanthus, a flower that grows in the dead of winter, will be a machine that will aid in snow removal for homeowners or industrial use.
